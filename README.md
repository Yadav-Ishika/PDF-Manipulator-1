â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ pdfm.py&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Streamlit App file<br />
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ requirements.txt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python dependencies for the project<br />
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ README.md&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project documentation (this file)<br />

# Usage
#### Since this project is a `streamlit`-based web application, so simply `py pdfm.py` won't help to execute this program, instead use
   ```bash
   streamlit run pdfm.py
```
